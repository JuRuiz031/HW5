Features:

This implementation of scrabble is able to create a random set of tiles from a given array (one I made by taking the JSON data given to us and then turning that into a usable array).
I tried to make the design of the js file modular by having things be split into multiple events and functions so that things only communicate with each other when they need to and
so that they do not 'cross-contaminate', basically.
So the main features are:
- Drag and Drop tiles
- Refresh tiles and Reset game buttons
- Checks for proper tile placement following given rules
- Calculate the score for the game

There are of course, things that are a bit wonky or buggy, or things I wanted to add but omitted or ran out of time to do:
- For some reason I cant get the rack behind the tiles to easily display properly without accidentally breaking something else
- I wanted to be able to check if a word was valid, but I ran out of time and energy to get that done in the time frame given to us.
- I wanted to also be able to 'undo' decisions up to a certain amount of times
- Of course I whish I had managed to also implement a full board instead of a single line version.
- I feel like my design for CSS and other images also lacks. It looks like a very elementary and basic and simple website and it shows, and that feels like a darn shame to made
- I wanted to implement alogn with a full board a way to have maybe multiple players playing the game, with each getting a rack and separate instances of letters and numbers.
I had an idea on how to implement this but I unfortunately just ran out of steam and also out of time.

Despite the list of things left out or that I wished worked better, I do feel like the page I made fits a majority if not all of the basic criteria for the assignment given to us.
I wish there was more time to do this but I also know the accelerated nature of this summer course limites everyones time and options for what to do. This was a very cool and very fun
homework and I hope in the future I have the time to work on it and further implement the things I want to add just for fun and for practice!

One final note, I want to thank the professor and the graders on this course, it was not just a blast but also incredibly intuitive, all things considered with it being online,
only one lecture a week AND with it being an accelerated course. You were very helpfult and communicative and the instructions and hints and help were always useful and welcomed.
I hope you all have a great summer and see you for the GUI2 Summer 2 class!
