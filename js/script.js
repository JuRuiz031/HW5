GUI1 HW5

This assignment was very hard since I am learning JS and all aspects of Web Dev from scratch. I will say it is a bit much but it is a ton of fun and I do think that the visual aspect of being able to see most of my changes happen in real
time is a lot of fun and helps with things feeling more intuitive! With that being said, I do think that the program needs some work and it does not have any of the fany bells and whistles that I wish it did. It does I think work
well enough to fit the criteria but it is definitely something that I feel is very basic and there is still so much left for me to learn when it comes to 

Thank you so much for all the help this Summer 1 course and I hope you have a great short summer break! See you in GUI2 Summer 2!
